"A Paper a Day keeps your advisor at bay!"

In general, the structure of the project is as follows:

\rb -> Ruby code. Primarily the PDF-extract code here.
\util -> Scripts for utility. primarily whatever makes tasks easier
\java|python -> Probably the hadoop code to proc data
\couch|mongo -> scripts / etc for setting up, using couch|mogno, which ever one we settle on.
